Once upon a time there was a boy named Sam. Sam had a pet rabbit he called
Simon. Simon and Sam lived in a small fishing village near the ocean.
Everyone in the village liked Simon because he was super cute. As a result
Sam's popularity grew aswell. 
One day, sam came back to home from work and he find out that Simon was not
 at home. Then he cried out sadly.
Sam, in his despair, swore to find who had stolen Simon. This rabbit meant everything to him. When thinking of suspects, he could only think of the rest of the people in his village. Everyone liked Simon, so naturally someone from the village must have taken him. The first person Sam investigated was his neighbor Randy.

As he was thinking, Randy came to his door, with simon on his hand.
"Pardon me, good neighbor." he did not look happy,"your lil rabbit pal just ate all my carrots this afternoon."
